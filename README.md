## Introduction

This repository contains all the code and needed images for my research about a functional programming language. This assignment is about learning a new language that interests me and differs from the language that we normally learn at school called Java (which is a object-oriÃ«nted programming language).

The goal of doing this assignment is to learn the new programming language and spread my gained knowledge about it to fellow students. So the new programming language that I am about to learn is Prolog. Prolog is a logic (declarative) programming language that is mostly based on predicate-logics (logics based on expressions/sayings). Logic is expressed as relations (also called Facts and Rules, which will be explained later). I chose Prolog because it is one of the most mentioned programming languages in functional programming, so I will be able to learn a lot because there is a lot written and documented online about Prolog. It was also recommended by my teacher (Michel Koolwaaij) last year at the course, where he showed a demostration of a Sudoku-solving application that he build.

For this assignment to be a success, I will do a challenge: implementing the shortest-path algorithm (Dijkstra) and demonstrating the algorithm. So obviously, the challenge will only be a success if I succesfully implement the algorithm. I will also allow me to implement some learning material of the APP-course to add some difficulty to my research. 

A lot of my information will come by this ![Youtube-tutorial][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SykxWpFwMGs]. My plan is to follow this guide and some other sources (that will be mentioned in the literature-list at the bottom of this README) to show what I learned about Prolog and to use that knowledge to implement my chosen challenge.

What I will use for this assignment:

  - Operating system: Windows 10 64-bit
  - SWI-Prolog as my IDE
